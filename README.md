I am the founder of a non-commercial research group called Style2Paints Research, and you can find my [researches and publications](https://lllyasviel.github.io/Style2PaintsResearch) in the website of Style2Paints Research.

I also have a tiny [personal page](https://lllyasviel.github.io/Style2PaintsResearch/lvmin).
